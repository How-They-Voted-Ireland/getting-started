Contributions to all aspects of this project are encouraged. Here are a few guidelines to make the process easier.

 - All PRs should have an associated issue. The issue should be tagged with `Ready`.
 - If you find a bug or want to add something that doesn't have an issue yet please create the issue and start a discussion aboiut the feature or bug.

We are doing this to prevent duplication of effort and to ensure your time is not wasted.

All contributiins will go trhough a review project with at least one maintainer approving.

There are linting rules in all the repos which should be adhered to.

20 August 2020 - A full CI/CD pipeline will be implemented soon with linting and tests being run. Curently there are no tests yet on the client repo, that will change soon plus a significant refactor of the code needs to happen to set some best practoses.
